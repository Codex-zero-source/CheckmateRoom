# Project Brief: ChessXCrypto

## 1. Core Concept

ChessXCrypto is a decentralized application (dApp) that combines the classic game of chess with modern blockchain technology. Built on the Somnia network, it allows users to play chess, bet on game outcomes, and earn cryptocurrency rewards in the form of the native Somnia test token (STT).

## 2. High-Level Goals

*   **Create a Web3 Chess Platform**: Develop a fully functional online chess platform where users can play against each other in real-time.
*   **Integrate Cryptocurrency**: Implement a token-based economy using the native Somnia test token (STT) for betting, rewards, and other in-app transactions.
*   **Enable Player and Spectator Betting**: Allow both players and spectators to place bets on the outcome of games, creating an engaging and interactive experience.
*   **Ensure Security and Transparency**: Leverage smart contracts to manage game logic, bets, and payouts in a secure and transparent manner.
*   **Provide a Seamless User Experience**: Design a user-friendly interface that abstracts away the complexities of blockchain interactions, making the dApp accessible to a broad audience.

*   **Chess Enthusiasts**: Players of all skill levels who are interested in a new way to play and compete.
*   **Cryptocurrency Users**: Individuals who are active in the Web3 space and are looking for new and innovative dApps.
