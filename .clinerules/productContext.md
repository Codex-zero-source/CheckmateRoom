# Product Context: ChessXCrypto

## 1. Problem Statement

The traditional online chess world, while popular, is largely disconnected from the emerging Web3 ecosystem. There's a missed opportunity to integrate the excitement of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology with the strategic depth of chess. Players lack a unified platform where they can not only play but also engage in a token-based economy, bet on outcomes, and be rewarded for their skills.

## 2. Vision

Our vision is to create the premier Web3 chess platform that seamlessly blends classic chess with a vibrant, decentralized economy. ChessXCrypto will be a place where players can compete, earn, and interact in a secure, transparent, and engaging environment. We aim to attract both seasoned chess players and crypto enthusiasts by offering a unique and rewarding experience.

## 3. Core User Stories

*   **As a chess player**, I want to play against others in real-time, so that I can test my skills and enjoy the game.
*   **As a user**, I want to bet on the outcome of my own games, so that I can add an extra layer of excitement and earn rewards for winning.
*   **As a spectator**, I want to watch live games and bet on the players, so that I can be part of the action and potentially earn tokens.
*   **As a crypto enthusiast**, I want to use my Somnia test tokens (STT) to participate in the ecosystem, so that I can engage with a new and innovative dApp.

## 4. User Experience Goals

*   **Seamless Onboarding**: Users should be able to connect their wallets and start playing with minimal friction.

*   **Secure and Trustworthy**: Users should feel confident that their funds are secure and that the game outcomes are fair.
